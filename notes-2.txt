This is the 2nd part of notes

* Tensorflow is a library for developing and training machine learning models.

* Transfer learning is the practice of using a pre-trained model towards a new task.

* Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of ML concerned with understanding text.

* R is a programming language for statistical analysis and visualization.

* Keras is a high-level API that's easier for ML beginners, as well as researchers.

What is learning rate, batch size, epochs 
activation function, loss function (sparse_categorical_crossentropy)
Numpy, scikit-learn, pytorch (this is derived from torch perhaps)
There are techniques like fine tuning as well

* numpy seems to be a library which supports mathematical operations on arrays. Pandas seem to be somewhat similar.
