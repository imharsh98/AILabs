# Machine Learning notes:

## General Theory

Perceptron: 

SVM: polynomial kernel, 

DT:

RF:

ANN: multi-layer perceptron

Tips and Tricks:

CNN:

filters, stride, 

## File structures

ANN.py:
    load the dataset


## How to read or understand the output:


HW1:
It is all SVM related. Checking the c-values and the different kernels which are needed.

HW2:
Decision Tree and Random Forest related.
